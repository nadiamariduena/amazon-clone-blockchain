### 1. create the folder for our app üç®

- Create or go to any folder where you want the project to take place.

<br>

- Open the terminal in that folder and type the following:

```javascript
// mkdir is going to create the folder where you want
mkdir amazon-clone-blockchain
```

<br>

#### 2. Once you do that, you have to <u>cd </u> in the folder

```javascript
// cd will enter to the folder
cd amazon-clone-blockchain
```

<br>

```javascript
npx create-next-app@latest .
```

> the **dot** here above, will make that everything that you are going to upload **"the starter packets related to netxjs"** is going to be downloaded to the amazon-clone-blockchain (so that we dont have a folder under a folder), lets see what happens if we dont add the dot

<br>

###### Here you can see what happens when i remove the dot in the beginning
